i had to ban evade since the mods of r/minecraft were lying to the users and banned me for calling them out 
they tricked the reddit mods into perm banning me i was doing what was right they never  had the right and my ban appeal got rejected on false grounds and why should a random sub mod get to decide were i can post
 i basicly got banned for being banned
 heres my origal accout Secure_Ad6815
 that will back up the account chain of the perm ban on my accounts
